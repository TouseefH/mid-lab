# Database and Cache Documentation and Readme file
### Database Service
The database service is a PostgreSQL database that stores data for the application. It is designed to handle high
traffic and provide fast query performance.
### Cache Service
The cache service is a Redis database that stores frequently accessed data to improve application performance.

## Running Services with Docker Compose

To run both the Database and Cache services using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the necessary environment variables.
4. Run the following command to start the services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up


## Environment Variable Management
### Purpose of the .env File
The .env file is used to manage environment variables for the project. It contains key-value pairs of configuration settings that are used by the application. This file helps to keep sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) secure and separate from the codebase.

## Managing Environment Variables
1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

2. Add environment variables
3. Load the environment variables into your application by using a library or tool that supports .env files.
